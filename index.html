    <h1>I'm Sorry, Ebrar</h1>
    <p>My dearest Ebrar,</p>
    <p>I know I can be foolish at times, and I make mistakes that hurt you. But please know this: when I realize what I've done wrong, I will always apologize and do anything to make it right—because you are everything to me.</p>
    <p>My love for you goes beyond infinity. It's endless, timeless, and it consumes me completely. I would do anything for you, change in every way, adapt to every moment—just to be the man you need me to be.</p>
    <p>Even if it means bleeding to death, I will still stand by you, fight for you, and love you with everything I have.</p>
    <p>Please forgive me, my love. I can't bear to lose you. I will prove to you every single day that I am yours—body, soul, and heart.</p>
    <p>Forever yours,</p>
    <p>Akif</p>
